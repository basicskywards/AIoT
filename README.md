### Contactless - Controlling the AC via a single touch using your Smartphone/iPad from anywhere
* No longer worry about where your AC remote control is.
* You can turn the AC on from anywhere outside if you want the house to get cool before heading back home.
* You can turn the AC off from anywhere outside if you forget this when leaving home.

### Touchless - Controlling the AC with simple hand gestures
* If you don’t want to hand-touch digital devices, AC can be still easily controlled by very simple hand gestures: ‘thumb up’ to turn on and ‘stop sign’ to turn off.
* It is user-friendly and suitable for children or elders.
 
### Flexible to switch between two controlling modes
* You can turn on the AC using your phone, and turn it off using hand gestures, and vice versa.
